## Monitoring Mangrove Restoration Using Sentinel-2 Imagery

This project is the capstone of my Master's program in Geomatics for Environmental Management (MGEM). In collaboration with Blue Ventures, a marine conservation 
organization, I studied mangrove restoration efforts in the Bay of Assassins, Madagascar. Using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and Google Earth Engine (GEM), I 
mapped mangrove forests from 2019 to 2024, measuring changes in forest area and vegetation health.

### Objectives
- **Quantify mangrove vegetation changes**: Identify areas of growth and loss.
- **Assess vegetation health**: Use spectral indices like NDVI to monitor health over time.

### Tools & Methods
- **Data**: Sentinel-2 satellite imagery (2019â€“2024), Mangrove Restoration sites in Madagascar.
- **Tools**: Google Earth Engine (GEM v2) for time-series analysis, QGIS & ArcGIS Pro for mapping and visualizations.
- **Analysis**: Quantify changes in mangrove extent, identify significant growth and loss areas, assess vegetation health.

### Key Results
- Significant changes in mangrove forest area and health were detectedin the region.
